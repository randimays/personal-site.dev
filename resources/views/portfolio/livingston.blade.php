				<p>A client required a design refresh for their existing website to accompany a large product launch for 2016-2017. I created this design using a 12-column Bootstrap guide in Adobe Photoshop and developed the design for the home page and several interior pages. The site is still in development as of June 2016 but will soon be live.</p>

I used a texture resembling fish scales and end-to-end color fields to differentiate between sections of the site and dug through a cornucopia of photos from trade shows and sponsored events to bring life to the head of the website with a photo strip.</p>

				<p>The primary goal of the redesign was to create an experience for the user. I restructured the existing content, wrote some new copy, and created collages of photos from live events and product launches while creating a cohesive look for each interior page. Sections of the site that required user input or interaction were refreshed with clean and open layouts to increase and encourage sales and account creation.</p>
